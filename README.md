#Write a Deaf Grandma program.

Whatever you say to grandma (whatever you type in), she should respond
with "HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!", unless you shout it (type in all
capitals).

If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so)
and yells back, "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!".

To make your program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each
time; maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950.
